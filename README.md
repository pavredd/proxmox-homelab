## Overview / Purpose
This project is a fully virtualized enterprise security lab built on proxmox to replicate a real-world corporate environment. It combines **system administration, network security, adversarial testing, and SIEM implementation** to simulate both attacker and defender perspectives.

The goal of this lab was to design, deploy, and secure a small enterprise network while gaining hands-on experience with Active Directory administration, firewall and IPS/IDS configuration, adversarial attack simulation, and centralized log monitoring with a SIEM.


## Key Skills Demonstrated
1. **Virtualization and Networking**
   - Proxmox VM provisioning.
   - Snapshot management.
   - Network segmentation (WAN/LAN interface seperation).
   - NAT and firewall rules.
2. **Firewall and Intrusion Prevention System / Intrusion Detection System**
   - pfSense firewall configuration.
   - Suricata IPS/IDS (inline block and alert modes).
   - Rule tuning.
3. **Enterprise Windows Administration**
   - Windows Server 2022 Active Directory Domain Services (reddy.lab).
   - Organizational Units (OUs) and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for LabUsers, Workstations, and domain-wide security policies.
   - Windows 11 domain join and policy enforcement testing.
4. **Adversarial Simulation (Red Team Testing)**
   - Kali Linux attacks (Nmap scans, Hydra brute force, SMB enumeration, ICMP floods).
   - Validation of attacker activity in pfSense firewall logs, Suricata eve.json, Windows Event Viewer, and SIEM dashboard.
5. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
   - Wazuh deployment on Ubuntu Server.
   - Windows agents installation and enrollment.
   - Centralized log collection and monitoring.
   - Detection and investigation of security events (failed logons, brute force, account lockouts).
6. **General Security Operations**
   - Log analysis across firewall, IPS/IDS, endpoint, and domain controller.
   - Detection-to-response workflow simulation (attack -> detection -> investigation).
   - Practical SOC analyst skills including correlation and incident documentation.

### pfSense Firewall and Suricata IPS/IDS
1. **pfSense Configuration:**
   - **Management** - pfSense web UI accessible at `https://<LAN_interface_IP>` for configuration and monitoring.
   - **WAN Interface** -  configured with static / private IP for controlled internet acces. IPv6 disabled.
   - **LAN Interface** - configured with static IP to serve the internal lab network for AD, endpoints, and SIEM.
   - **Firewall Rules Setup:**
     - **WAN Rules**
       - Block private networks {RFC1918) from WAN.
       - Block bogon networks.
     - **LAN rules**
       - Anti-Lockout Rule - ensures admin access to pfSense is never blocked.
       - Default Allow LAN to Any - permits lab VM communications within LAN and outbound traffic.
   - **NAT configuration**:
     - **Port forwarding** - RDP (TCP 3389) forwarded to AD-Server2022 and win11-ENT1 to test external attack scenarios.
     - **Temporary testing** - NAT reflection and Outbound NAT enabled for internal testing and reverted afterward.  
2. **Suricata Setup:**
   - **Mode Configuration:**
     - **WAN Interface** - Inline mode with block offenders enabled to actively drop malicious traffic.
     - **LAN Interface** - Alert-only mode for monitoring internal network traffic without blocking.
   - **Rule Categories Enabled:**
     - ET SCAN
     - ET ATTACK_RESPONSE
     - ET EXPLOIT
     - ET MALWARE
     - ET SHELLCODE
     - ET DOS
     - ET BOTCC
     - ET WORM
   - **Rule Action Customization:**
     - Modified selected ET rules to `drop`, ensuring traffic that matched these signatures was both alerted and blocked.
     - **Custom Rules:**
       - Local RDP Brute Force Attempt rule - created to detect and block unauthorized RDP login attempts.
       - Local ICMP Flood Detection rule - created for ICMP flood testing. However, detections were ultimately handled by the existing GPL SCAN Nmap Ping rule in the ET SCAN category, demonstrating Suricataâ€™s rule precedence.
     - **Logging** - enabled Eve JSON Logging to capture all alerts and drops in `eve.json`. Logs were accessible through both the pfSense web UI and console for review.
    

### Windows Server 2022
1. **Server Role:**
   - Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role on Windows Server 2022 (AD-Server2022)
   - Promoted server to Domain Controller and created a new forest `reddy.lab`.
2. **Networking:** Configured static IPv4 LAN IP for consistent domain communication.
3. **Domain Configuration:**
   - Established root domain `reddy.lab`.
   - Created Organizational Units (OUs) `LabUsers` and `Workstations` for logical structure.
4. **Group Policy Objectives:**
   - Implemented baseline hardening and user environment controls, including:
     - **Authentication & Security** â€“ password complexity, account lockout policies.
     - **Advanced Audit Policy Configuration** - logon events, object access, policy changes, privilege use, etc.
     - **Access Restrictions** â€“ disabled Control Panel, Task Manager, Registry Editor, Command Prompt, and Windows Settings.
     - **User Environment** â€“ enforced shared drive mapping, file sharing / folder redirection for centralized access, and applied corporate wallpaper.
     - **System Updates** â€“ configured Windows Update to manual (notify).

### Windows 11 Enterprise (Endpoint)
1. **Networking:** Configured with static IPv4 LAN IP for stable connectivity within the lab network.
2. **Domain Membership:**
   - Joined to the Active Directory domain `reddy.lab`.
   - User account from the `LabUsers` OU was used to log in and validate domain authentication.
3. **Testing Role:**
   - Served as a controlled endpoint for validating GPO enforcement.
   - Used as a target system for attack simulations from Kali Linux (RDP brute force, SMB brute force, ICMP flood) to validate firewall and IDS/IPS effectiveness.


### Kali Linux (Attacker VM)
1. **Networking:**
   - Configured with dual network interfaces for targeted attack scenarios:
     - **WAN Interface** - Static IP used for external attack simulations against the labâ€™s WAN Interface.
     - **LAN Interface** - Static IP used for internal attack simulations within the lab network.
   - Ensured correct interface usage by explicitly binding tools to interfaces (e.g., `-e eth1`) wherever applicable. 
2. **Attack Toolset:**
   - **Nmap** â€“ for network discovery and port scanning (SYN, TCP, and UDP).
   - **Hydra** â€“ for brute force password attacks against RDP and SMB.
   - **SMBClient / Enum4linux** â€“ for SMB enumeration and probing domain-related information.
   - **Hping3** â€“ for simulating ICMP flood traffic.
3. **Testing Role:**
   - Served as the controlled attacker system for simulating both WAN-side and LAN-side adversarial activities.
   - Attack traffic was later validated through pfSense firewall logs, Suricata `eve.json` logs, and Wazuh SIEM.
